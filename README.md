# Fake-News-Detection-using-Machine-Learning

Introduction:

The Fake News Detection project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately detect fake news articles. The project involves the analysis of a large dataset of news articles, the preprocessing of the articles to extract relevant features, and the development of a machine learning model to classify the news articles as fake or real based on these features. The project is implemented using Python and its various data analysis and machine learning libraries.

# Objectives:

The main objectives of the project are:

To analyze a large dataset of news articles and preprocess the articles to extract relevant features.
To develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify news articles as fake or real based on these features.
To evaluate the performance of the model using various performance metrics and fine-tune the model to improve its performance.
To deploy the model as a web application to make it accessible to users.
# Data:

The project uses the Fake and Real News Dataset, which contains more than 20,000 news articles labeled as fake or real. The dataset is available on Kaggle and is used as the primary data source for the project(https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/fake-news/data).

# Methodology:

The project follows the following methodology:

Data preprocessing: The raw dataset is cleaned, and the articles are preprocessed to extract relevant features such as the article title, article content, and the source of the article. Text preprocessing techniques such as stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization are used to reduce the feature space.

Model development: Various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes are developed and evaluated using cross-validation. The model with the best performance is selected.

Model fine-tuning: Various techniques such as hyperparameter tuning and feature selection are used to improve the model's performance. The model is fine-tuned using these techniques and evaluated on the test set.

# Conclusion:

The Fake News Detection project is an important machine learning project that aims to detect fake news articles. The project involves various stages such as data preprocessing, model development, model fine-tuning, and deployment. The project provides a valuable insight into the fake news detection problem and provides a practical solution that can be used by news organizations to detect and prevent the spread of fake news.
